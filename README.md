# french_departments_quiz

Simple flutter project to test the language.
The goal of the app is to help people learn the French departments with their number and capital.

Originally developped to help me get better at Geoguessr.

The departments are stored in a JSON file.

Maybe I'll make a better GUI, and some user-friendly interactions sucha as showing explicitly when the answer is correct and a mean to display the correct answer after X tries.
